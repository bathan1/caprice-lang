# caprice-lang

This project implements the Caprice programming language.

Caprice is a semantically typed functional language with types as values.

```ocaml
(* types are values. pos_int is a type value *)
let pos_int : type = { i : int | i > 0 }

(* modules are first class values *)
let Collection : sig
  (* t is a function on types *)
  val t : type -> type
  (* provided any type, empty is the empty collection of values of that type *)
  val empty : (type a) -> t a
  val add : (type a) -> a -> t a -> t a
end = struct
  (* list is a function on types *)
  let t = list
  (* the empty collection can ignore its type argument *)
  let empty _ = []
  let add _ a c = a :: c
end

(* the return type of factors depends on the argument n *)
let factors (dep n : pos_int) (* hence n is marked dep for "dependent" *)
  : Collection.t { m : pos_int | n % m == 0 } = (* return a collection of n's positive divisors *)
  let rec factors (dep i : pos_int) : Collection.t { k : int | k >= i && n % k == 0 } =
    if i > n then
      Collection.empty int (* return the empty collection of integers *)
    else if n % i == 0 then
      Collection.add int i (factors (i + 1))
    else
      factors (i + 1)
  in
  factors 1
```

## Installation

Caprice is built with OCaml 5.5.0~alpha1.

Via opam, install OCaml 5.5.0~alpha1 and then install the dependencies. Answer y/yes to all questions:

```cmd
opam update
opam switch create 5.5.0~alpha1
opam install . --deps-only
```

Then, build the repository with dune:

```cmd
dune build
make test
```

The installation is tested on WSL2 for Windows 11. To use the landmarks profiling tool, see the recent [pull request](https://github.com/LexiFi/landmarks/pull/47) for compatibility with ppxlib >= 0.36.0 and OCaml 5.5 features. It will require a local opam pin to use landmarks in caprice-lang until that PR appears in the next release. Profiling is not required to run Caprice.

## Developing

Develop in the caprice-lang repository with the following developer tools:

```cmd
opam install ocaml-lsp-server
```

If you are using VS Code, use the OCaml Platform extension.

To write programs in the Caprice language, it's suggested to install the VS Code language extension. Navigate to the `caprice-language-extension` directory and follow the instructions in `README.md` there.

## Programming with Caprice

Write Caprice programs in `.caprice` files. With the project built, you can run the type checker with the `./typecheck.exe` executable. For example,

```cmd
./typecheck.exe filename.caprice
```

type checks `filename.caprice`. The output may contain one of several messages:
- `Exhausted`: every possible program path was run and exhausted, and **the program is well-typed**.
- `Found error`: the type checker found some type refutation, so **the program is ill-typed**.
- `Exhausted pruned tree`: many program paths were run, and the tree was exhausted up to some depth without error, but the program may still be ill-typed.
- `Timeout`: no error was found within the allowed time, so the program may still be ill-typed.
- `Unknown`: the SMT solver failed to return an answer quickly, so some program path was skipped, but no error was found otherwise; the program may still be ill-typed.
