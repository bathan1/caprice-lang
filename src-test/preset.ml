  Preset: splaying can quickly prove this well typed, or the program
    has finitely many paths.

    flags += " -r";
    typecheck;

(*
  Preset: there is a refutation, i.e. a path that shows the program is ill-typed.
    First tries to type splay, which will go wrong. Then tries to refute without
    type splaying, where an error is then found.

  (* TEST
    typing = ill-typed;

  ]

(*
  Preset: there are infinitely many paths, and splaying is
    incomplete; we are expecting timeout on these tests.
