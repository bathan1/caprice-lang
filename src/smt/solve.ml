(*
  First attempts to solve with a few heuristics, and then calls the solver.
  This simply special-cases on some common formulas. It also extracts out
  constant assignments (variable = constant).

  Since the `binop` function in Formula turns greater-thans into less-thans, we
  don't handle any greater-than in the cases below--it will never happen since
  the user can only construct formulas with the smart constructors.
  Similarly, we will not get "not" of an inequality operator.

  As more simplifiers are added, we could instead name this after implied
  concretization.
